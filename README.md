# Project Background
Sucden Coffee Group, a global soft commodities trading, processes and commercializes both Arabica and Robusta qualities worldwide.
The companies has significant amount of data on the Local Sustainability Team from coffee-producing regions over the world that has been previously underultilized. This project throughly analyzes and synthesizes this data in order to uncover critical insights that will help the Manager to navigate Team's progress success.
Insights and recommmendations are provided on the following key areas:
* **Risk Analysis**: Evaluation of deforestation risk assessment, both regionally and by local group, focusing on the Risk Percentage (%) in different categories of Approval Status.
* **Producing Volume Performance**: An analysis of local coffee volume, understanding their current yield, farm area, and estimated coffee volume produced.
* **Regional Comparisons**: An evaluation of the number of farmers registered and data collection progress by region.

The Python script ultilized to combine, process data from various Excel files can be found here.

# Executive Summary
**Overview of Local Teams**

The company's teams operates across multiple regions, with dedicated teams in Brazil, Colombia, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, collaborating with approximately 8,500 farmers. These farmers primarily cultivate Arabica and Robusta coffee, contributing to a diverse and high-quality portfolio. With a total coffee production volume exceeding 80,000 tons in the previous year.

**Producing Volumne Performance**

* **The teams have visited over 10,000 coffee farms and collected over 90%** of position geolocation data from the local farmers.
* **Vietnam produced approximately 25,000 tons of coffee last year**, making it the largest Robusta coffee-producing country in the group. **India ranks second, with 13,000 tons of coffee produced.**
* **Despite with only 52 farm plots,Brazil, holds over 85% of the first place for Arabica**, producing 19,000 tons. Colombia ranks first with nearly 22,000 tons produced

**Risk Assessment**

* **Indonesia and Colombia, overall, are the countries with a >10% deforestation alert rate after approved by the Team.** This is mainly due to the large number of farmers who have cut down trees for farmland in forest areas over the past 5 years.
* **Colombia has over 100 farmers flagged for alert despite evidence** being brought to the local team. This has resulted in the team allocating resources to visit local fields and gather more evidence to verify the situation for these farmers.
* **Brazil has nearly 0% of alerts for positions in deforestation risk areas**, due to highly strict regulations on opening farmland in one of the largest agricultural countries.
